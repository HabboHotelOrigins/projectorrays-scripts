# ProjectorRays scripts

Small scripts, created by EntenKoeniq.

## How it works
All files to be decompiled must be located in the `files` folder. If no `files` folder exists, create one and add the files there.

### Windows
You can simply double-click the file `run.bat` to execute it.

### Linux
- Make `run.sh` executable by `chmod +x run.sh`.
- Make `projectorrays` executable by `chmod +x projectorrays`.
- Now use the command `./run.sh`.

## Folders
- The `files` folder contains all the files to be decompiled.
- The `src` folder contains all `.cst` and `.dir` files.
- - Will be deleted if it already exists.
- The `scripts` folder contains all `.ls` and `.lasm` files.
- - Will be deleted if it already exists.
